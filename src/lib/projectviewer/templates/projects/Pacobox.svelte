<h1>Pacobox</h1>
Pacobox is a simply Python script that lets you change your IP when on an Orange France router.
<br><br>
All it does is pretty much just act like you clicked a button on your web panel with some small but nice additional features like:
<ul>
    <li>Save previous IPs</li>
    <li>Tell you when your IP has changed</li>
    <li>Show your new IP after the change</li>
</ul>

<h2>Source</h2>
<SelfLink link="github.com/Nixuge/Pacobox" />

<h2>Usage</h2>
Simply run pacobox.py (you don't even need to clone the repo, everything is in a single file)
<br><br>
If you're missing anything, the script will tell you what and where to get them.

<h1>This is obviously ONLY for Orange routers. It won't work anywhere else.</h1>
